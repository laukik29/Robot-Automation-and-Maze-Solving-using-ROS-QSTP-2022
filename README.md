# Robot Automation and Maze Solving using ROS QSTP 2022
Course material of Robot Automation and Maze Solving using ROS QSTP 2022

This repository contains all material from the Robot Automation using ROS summer course taught by [Laukik B Nakhwa](https://github.com/laukik29), [Yash Yelmame](https://github.com/TheRandomizer7), [Manan Arora](https://github.com/Manaro-Alpha) as part of the QSTP initiative. Automation and Control in Robotics is a fast growing field with exciting innovations coming out with a rapid pace. In this course we hope to familiarise you with the basic tools and techniques that are at the core of such developments.

## Course Structure
The course begins from scratch by covering the basics of Python including branching, looping, basic I/O and functions. The key tool you will be learning in the course is the Robotics Operating System (ROS) - a software framework designed to make robotics development easier. Along with this you will also be working with Gazebo which is a robotics simulator where you can create your own robot models or even test out code on pre-existing TrotBot which is an Omniwheeled robot.

The final project is programming an autonomous ground robot, this will involve combining the tasks you will do over the course of the 4 weeks.

## Software Requirements
We recommend that you try installing ROS before the beginning of the QSTP. We have also dedicated the first week to setup and installation so that we can troubleshoot any issues you may face. We will be putting up detailed instructions for the process on the QSTP repository. For those unable to set up Ubuntu for whatever reason, please put it up on the group or contact one of the team, we will try to work out some alternatives.

OS: Ubuntu 16.04 /18.04 /20.04 | Ubuntu on Virtual Machine (for Windows) | ROS Docker Image (for [MacOS](https://www.xiaokeyang.com/blog/using_ros_with_docker_in_macos) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/))
Software: ROS [Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) (for Ubuntu 16.04) or ROS [Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) (for Ubuntu 18.04) or ROS [Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) (for Ubuntu 20.04)
Python 2.7+ (usually pre-installed with Ubuntu OS)
Useful Tools: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Terminator](https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## What is QSTP?
Quark Summer Technical Projects (QSTP) is a platform where experienced BITS students (currently in their 2/3/4th year); part of the clubs or independently; mentor Project-centric Courses for other students over the summer.
